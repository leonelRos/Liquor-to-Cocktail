      <p>
        This page was built by a former bartender. Back in college, I was
        working at a local restaurant where I learned the basics of customer
        service and client needs (literally). I was nerver able to remember
        every single cocktail in the world besides those straight up liquor
        mixed with juice or sodas. Therefore, I got the inspiration to develop
        this app and hopefully someday submitted to app store or google store or
        whichever company dominates upon us. I want to thank you to my former
        employers and and my crew who I briefly rememeber if it was not for
        those friday late nights at a bar drinking and making fun of the
        customers(Analyzing the client needs). It is such a pleasure and I hope
        this tool to be helpful for the future generations.
